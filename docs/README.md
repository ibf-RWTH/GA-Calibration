This repository presents an enhanced version of the Discrete Representative Volume Element (RVE) Automation and Generation Framework, known as DRAGen. Originally devised as an approach for generating Representative Volume Elements based on a Random Sequential Addition (RSA)-Algorithm and discrete tessellation, DRAGen has undergone significant improvements to broaden its capabilities. DRAGen collects and processes data from analysis of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) images via the [MATLAB toolbox MTEX](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/)  or [OIM](https://www.edax.com/products/ebsd/oim-analysis) and presents it as a model. Subsequently, the generator follows the below mentioned steps:

* Randomly generating ellipsoids in volume (RSA)
* Filling empty spaces between ellipsoids (Discrete Tessellation)
* Validation of the newly created digital microstructure with input data

The updated framework incorporates a generator for RVEs with several advanced features, drawn from real microstructures. DRAGen now possesses the ability to read input data from trained neural networks and .csv files, offering greater flexibility in microstructure generation. Notably, the generator has been enriched to reconstruct microstructures with intricate features such as;

* Pores
* Inclusions 
* Martensite bands 
* Hierarchical substructures
* Crystallographic textures.

In addition to these enhancements, DRAGen has been extended to support different solvers. DRAGen is capable of creating models compatible with three widely used multiphysics frameworks: [DAMASK](https://damask.mpie.de/index.html), [Abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/), and [MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/).

Its versatility makes it a valuable tool for scientists in the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) community. The modular architecture of the project facilitates easy expansion with additional features, ensuring that DRAGen delivers a diverse range of functions and outputs. This diversity offers a comprehensive spectrum of microstructures, thereby contributing to the advancement of microstructure studies and the development of innovative microstructure designs.

## Installation

As the first step, conda needs to be installed.
To be sure conda is installed correctly on your system [look up here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)<br>

Git must be installed on the system. Check with:
```
$ git --version
```
If it has not been installed use this:
```
$ conda install -c anaconda git
```
Open the user path and create the directory where the DRAGen repo will be cloned.
Should be like this:
```
(base) C:\Users> cd \Users\{username}
(base) C:\Users\username> mkdir GitRepos
(base) C:\Users\username> cd GitRepos
```
To clone this repository into the desired destination, use:<br>
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ibf-RWTH/DRAGen.git
```
To be able to use DRAGen, the working directory must be set to the location where the repo was downloaded to in the previous step file which is downloaded at the previous step.
Use the commands to go to the exact file by following the path.
```
$ cd DRAGen
```
To see the folders on the current point:
```
$ dir
```
Create a virtual environment as follows:<br>
```
$ conda create --name DRAGen python=3.10
$ conda activate DRAGen
```
(if an error occurs check your conda installation)<br>
To see the list of the environments on conda:
```
$ conda info --envs
```
Be sure the DRAGen environment is activated it should look somewhat like this:<br>
```
(DRAGen)....$ 
```
Install one of two required module packages depending on cuda availability on the device:

To install requirements without cuda:<br> 
```
(DRAGen)....$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
To install requirements if cuda is available:<br> 
```
(DRAGen)....$ pip install -r requirements_cuda.txt 
```
Check if every step is utilized correctly by running first generation with:<br>
```
(DRAGen)....$ python DRAGen_nogui.py
```
Run DRAGen:<br>
```
(DRAGen)....$ python DRAGen.py
```
